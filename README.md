# algo-contests
C++ implementation of various algorithms useful at programming contests.

## Summary

This repository contains a bunch of C++ files with algorithm implementations useful in algorithmic programming contests (e.g. Google Code Jam, Meta Hacker Cup, Topcoder SRMs). These files are not intended to be used as a library, just to provide example implementations which can be tailored to the various use cases based on the actual contest problems.
